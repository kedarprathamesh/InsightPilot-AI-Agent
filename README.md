# InsightPilot-AI-Agent
📊 AI Senior Data Analyst Web AppThis is a single-file Flask web application that utilizes the Gemini API to simulate the role of a Senior Data Analyst. It takes a natural language description of a dataset or analysis goal and instantly generates a comprehensive report, including a Data Usability Score, Key Metrics (like Year-over-Year analysis), Simulated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Strategic Next Steps.✨ FeaturesSenior Analyst Persona: The model acts as an experienced analyst, providing strategic, actionable insights.Key Metrics Generation: Specifically engineered to suggest and calculate relevant metrics, including time-series comparisons (YOY).Clean Web Interface: Uses Flask for the backend and Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional, and responsive user interface.Markdown Rendering: Uses Showdown.js client-side to beautifully render the detailed Markdown reports generated by the Gemini model.Single-File Deployment: The entire application (Python logic, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is self-contained in a single data_analysis_app.py file.🚀 Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesPython 3.xA Gemini API Key (available from Google AI Studio)StepsClone the Repository (or download data_analysis_app.py):git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]
Install Dependencies:pip install Flask requests
Set Your API Key:The application reads the API key from an environment variable named GEMINI_API_KEY.Linux/macOS:export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Windows (Command Prompt):set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
Windows (PowerShell):$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Note: You can also hardcode the key directly in data_analysis_app.py if needed, but using an environment variable is recommended for security.Run the Application:python data_analysis_app.py
The application will start, usually accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.💡 UsageOpen the application in your web browser.In the text area, describe your dataset (e.g., column names, data types, context) and your analysis goals.Example Prompt: "I have a dataset of customer activity with columns: customer_id, subscription_date, monthly_spend, and region. I need key metrics for the last two years and an assessment of churn risk."Click the "Generate Senior Analysis" button.The application will display a detailed, professional report featuring:Data Usability ScoreUsability AssessmentKey Metrics & Suggested Calculations (YOY, CTR, etc.)Simulated EDA & InsightsNext Steps for a Senior Analyst⚙️ Project StructureThe project is entirely contained within one file for simplicity:data_analysis_app.py: Contains the complete Flask web server, the Gemini API logic, and the full HTML/Tailwind CSS template.
